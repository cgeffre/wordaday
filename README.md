# SETUP

To use the application locally, clone the repository and set your IDE to compile the application using Java Development Kit (JDK) 11. You may need to have Gradle installed if you are not compiling the application from IntelliJ IDEA or Spring Tool Suite. You will need to set up your own application.properties file in the resources directory with the database settings you wish to use.

# TECHNICAL INFORMATION

This project was developed in Spring Boot using a Model-View-Controller framework with REST APIs. It is primarily built in Java along with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, with ThymeLeaf handling templating. The build utilizes Gradle. Random words are generated by a random word API and the application then queries the Merriam-Webster Dictionary API for definitions. MySQL with Hibernate is used for persistence.
